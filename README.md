# DS-Algo

This repository contains my solution for common Data Structures &amp; algorithms. I've created this repository to learn
about algorithms and improve solutions to common computer science problems.

# Algorithms & data structures project

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design. Creating and designing
excellent algorithms is required for being an exemplary programmer. This repository's goal is to demonstrate how to
correctly implement common data structures and algorithms in the simplest and most elegant ways. This repository
provides algorithm implementations in Java
